All three formatting conditions—Plain, XML, and Sandwich—produced 
perfectly correct answers. This occurs because a highly robust 
frontier model like Llama-3.3-70B can easily extract the correct 
information from a relatively small, clean, and low-noise dataset, 
regardless of whether there are any explicit structural markers provided.

The Holyrood Arms is the most dangerous distractor because it partially 
matches the search criteria. It satisfies the capacity and vegan requirements, 
failing only on the availability status. This makes it highly likely to 
trick a model that stops evaluating early or casually skims the text.

PART_C_EXPLANATION = """
Even with the smaller 8B model and the addition of near-miss distractors, 
all three formatting conditions yielded the correct answer. This shows that 
the task's context size and distractors still presented a high enough 
signal-to-noise ratio for the 8B model to easily succeed without explicit 
formatting help.

CORE_LESSON = """
Context formatting matters most when the signal-to-noise ratio is exceedingly low, 
such as when dealing with extensively long contexts, many near-miss distractors, 
or complex data formats. In these challenging scenarios, structural markers like 
XML tags and sandwich instructions become crucial hooks to properly guide 
the model's attention mechanism.
